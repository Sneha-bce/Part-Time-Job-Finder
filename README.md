# Part-Time-Job-Finder
The Part-Time Job Finder is a Java application that helps users find part-time jobs matching their skills and location. It supports job posting, searching, and filtering to make job hunting efficient and accessible, especially for students and freelancers seeking flexible work.

Problem Definition: 
Many students and freelancers struggle to find part-time jobs that match their skills, location, and availability efficiently.

Objectives: 
Develop a Java application to facilitate posting, searching, and filtering part-time jobs to simplify job hunting and improve access to opportunities.

Course Concepts Applied: 
Object-oriented programming for class design, data structures for job storage and search, file handling for data persistence, and modularization for maintainability.

Tools & Techniques: 
Java core libraries, ArrayLists for dynamic data handling, Scanner for user input, file I/O for saving job data, and optionally JavaFX or Swing for GUI.

Structured Development Process:

Requirement Analysis: Identify user needs like job posting, searching, filtering, and notifications.
Top-Down Design/Modularization: Break into modules - User Interface, Job Management, Data Persistence, and Search Logic.
Algorithm Development: Implement search algorithms for keyword and location matching, sorting by relevance.
Implementation: Code the modules with clean, reusable methods and classes.

Testing & Refinement: Test for different search scenarios, invalid inputs, and refine UI and performance based on feedback.

This systematic approach ensures a well-architected, practical project that demonstrates theoretical concepts with real-world application.
